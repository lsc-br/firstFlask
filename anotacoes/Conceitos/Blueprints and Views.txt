Blueprints and ViewsÂ¶

    A view function is the code you write to respond to requests to your application. Flask uses patterns to match the
    incoming request URL to the view that should handle it. The view returns data that Flask turns into an outgoing
    response. Flask can also go the other direction and generate a URL to a view based on its name and arguments.
